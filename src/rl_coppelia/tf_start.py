Project: Robot Training and Testing RL Algorithms in CoppeliaSim

Description:
    This script launches TensorBoard to visualize the training metrics of a specified reinforcement learning model.
    It parses the model name, locates the corresponding TensorBoard logs directory, and opens the TensorBoard interface
    in the default web browser once the data becomes available.

Usage:
    uncore_rl tf_start --model_name <model_name>
                         [--verbose <0|1|2|3>]
Features:
    - Automatically launches a CoppeliaSim instance for testing.
    - Loads a preconfigured scene and initializes the corresponding environment.
    - Supports testing multiple models across multiple targets in a single execution.
    - Dynamically assigns models to scene targets based on model count.
    - Automatically detects and loads trained models using the correct SB3 algorithm.
    - Measures and logs key performance metrics such as reward, time, crashes, and target zone.
    - Saves detailed episode metrics and a summary CSV with aggregated statistics.
    - Calculates episode trajectory distance if no collision is detected.
    - Cleans up and stops CoppeliaSim after testing is complete.
