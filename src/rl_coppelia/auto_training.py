Description:
    This script manages the execution of a special training mode for robots in a CoppeliaSim 
    environment. It automates the discovery of configuration files (JSON), and executes 
    multiple training sessions accordingly. The method is useful for testing different 
    training configurations efficiently and reproducibly.

    Executes multiple training runs using pre-defined parameter files located inside a session
    directory. Supports both sequential and parallel execution, and stores the results in a
    summary CSV file.

Usage:
    uncore_rl auto_training --robot_name <robot_name> --session_name <session_name>
                               [--dis_parallel_mode] 
                               [--max_workers <num>] 
                               [--timestamp <timestamp>] 
                               [--verbose <0|1|2|3>]

Features:
    - Automatically detects and loads all param.json files from the session directory.
    - Supports parallel or sequential training execution based on user preference.
    - Applies configurable delay between process submissions to avoid collisions.
    - Tracks and stores the status and duration of each training in a CSV file.
    - Ensures reproducibility by preserving training metadata and timestamps.
    - Helps benchmark different training settings easily in batch mode.
